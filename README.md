## Description
This project came from a character created by [Thaís](https://github.com/Thais-Damasio) and [Vinícius](https://github.com/vinicpac). The main idea is building an organized and didactic structure to make games using purely Javascript, CSS and HTML.

Therefore, Pachecolândia is not only a game, but it is a didactic project which aims helping new developers to know a little bit more about the Javascript world![love][Heart].

## Developers
* [Thaís Damásio](https://github.com/thais-damasio)

***
## Dependences
The game works only with HTML, CSS and Javascript files. However, the development environment is supported by **Node.js** packages :D

***
## Get Started
* To run the project use the command:

    ```npm run dev```

* The static files (*CSS*, *HTML* and *javascript*) of the project are going to save into the folder `dist/` which is going to be generated at the project root. To generate them use the command:
